# Overview

A place to put miscellaneous algorithms, data structures, and programming examples.

This project currently builds with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, but depends mostly on the C++ standard library, coupled with GLFW 3.0.4 and OpenGL 1.1, and should be portable to most platforms.

# Current examples

- search: An interactive demonstration of how certain search algorithms behave.
- raytrace: A small raytracer with an interactive OpenGL preview.
